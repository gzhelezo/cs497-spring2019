# Notes
The world wide web has completely changed the way people use computers. We use it for banking, shopping, education, communication, news, entertainment. 

A web browser identifies a web site with a uniform resource locator or URL. The naming scheme is invented by Tim Burns Lee.

For example, ```https://ycpcs.github.io/cs497-spring2019/schedule.html```, 
```https://ycpcs.github.io``` is the domain name of the web server holding the web site of interest, and the file ```schedule.html``` is the file describing the text and images for a page on this web site using a format called HTML- Hypertext Markup Language. 

Frequently, the name of the file is left out of a URL, in which case a default file is requested, such as ```index.html``` or ```home.html```.

HTML Describes the content and formatting of Web Pages and it is rendered within the browser window.
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>Test from CS 497</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
Some of the HTML features:
 - Static document description language 
 - Supports linking to other pages and embedding images 
 - User input sent to server via forms

```html
<form>
  First Name: <input type="text" name="fname"><br/>
  Last Name: <input type="text" name="lname"><br/>
  <button type="button">Click Me!</button>
</form>
```

HTML supports plugins â€“ usually for additional media content (PDF, video, music) 
 - Embedding programs in supported languages (JavaScript) provides dynamic content that interacts with the user, modifies the browser User Interface and can access computer environment.
