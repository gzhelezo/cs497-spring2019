Cyber Security Ethics
====================================

**Spring 2019**

In this class, you will be exposed to knowledge and techniques that can be used for hacking, penetrating and attacking computer systems.

While these are an integral part of a course on Computer Security, applying them **in the real world** can lead to violation of local and international laws and/or of institutional policies. This may have very serious consequences: do not take it lightly. 

We will be discussing attacks in this class, some of them quite nasty. None of this is in any way an invitation to undertake these attacks in any fashion other than with informed consent of all involved and affected parties. The existence of a security hole is no excuse. These issues concern not only professional ethics, but also YCP policy and state and federal law. If there is any question in your mind about what conduct is allowable, contact the instructors first.
