# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attack Lab
Cross-site request forgery, abbreviated as CSRF or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website whereby unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts.

### Lab Description and Tasks

The objective of this lab is to help students understand the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF) attack. A CSRF attack involves a victim user, a trusted site, and a malicious site. The victim user holds an active session with a trusted site while visiting a malicious site. The malicious site injects an HTTP request for the trusted site into the victim user session, causing damages.

Launching the cross-site request forgery attack on a vulnerable web application. Conducting experiments with several countermeasures.
